## [v1.9.9]

- Fixed:

  - #63: Fixed an issue where the debug adapter reported "no available debug program" preventing the variables request from being sent. The debugger now correctly initializes and attaches to the target.
  - #64: Addressed redundant folding ranges requests from VS Code, reducing unnecessary processing and improving UI responsiveness.
  - #65: Resolved a problem with file URI handling during debug sessions (e.g., URIs with scheme 'file') which previously caused instability in path resolution.
  - #67: Fixed an issue where the extension failed to recognize certain project types, leading to errors in parsing and updating project configurations.

- Optimized:
  - Various improvements derived from the git diff changes, including enhancing event handling in key modules and refining resource mapping logic to further stabilize file and debug operations.

---

## [v1.9.8]

- Fixed:
  - #62: Fixed a bug where the extension would fail to update the c_cpp_properties.json file when the project contained multiple targets. This issue was caused by the incorrect handling of the targetInfo array during the update process.
- Optimized:
  - Refactored FileWatcher.ts to exclusively use chokidar's watch API for both file and directory monitoring. This change unifies event handling, reduces redundant resource usage, and improves overall stability.
  - Streamlined the package.json scripts by removing redundant installation calls (e.g., eliminating extra "yarn install" within the build commands) and simplifying build/publish workflows for a cleaner development experience.

---

## [v1.9.7]

- Optimized:
  - #57: Optimized the updateCppProperties method by caching the Array.from conversion of this.includes and this.defines, reducing redundant conversions to lower memory usage and boost performance.
  - #58: Refactored the assignment logic for includePath and defines to adopt a unified conversion strategy, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
  - #59: Performed comprehensive project refactoring to improve overall code structure, modularity, and performance.
  - #60: Improved the writing logic for c_cpp_properties.json to ensure a more efficient and stable update process.
